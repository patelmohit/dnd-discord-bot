# dnd-discord-bot
A Discord bot to automate tedious DND activities ðŸ˜„

## Build

I would highly recommend following the [Building your first Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started) instructions to get a Discord app set up. You will need to insert credentials to a `.env` file - rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`, and replace `<YOUR_APP_ID>`, `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>`, and `<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>`.

The easiest way to build out this repo is using Docker:
```
docker build . -t dnd-discord-bot
```
To run the app locally, you can use the provided, simple docker-compose file:
```
docker compose up -d
```
The rust app will listen on port 3000. At this point, you need the app to have a publically accessible endpoint (i.e. port 3000 needs to be reachable via the internet). This depends on where you will be hosting this application - a reverse proxy on a host with a DNS entry will work, or ngrok can be used as well.

Once your app is reachable on the internet, add your url to the Interaction Endpoint URL configuration on your Discord app, and append `/interactions` to that url (since that is the endpoint the app is listening on).
